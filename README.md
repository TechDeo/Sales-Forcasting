- `data/`: Placeholder for any datasets used (please upload your data files here if necessary).

## Key Insights

- **Seasonality:** August had the highest sales; Q2 was the weakest.
- **Customer Loyalty:** Region 6 had the highest loyalty and unit orders.
- **Sales Trend:** Growth from 2019 to 2021; significant dip in 2022.
- **Modeling:** Gradient Boosting Regressor was selected for its low RMSE and suitability for time series.

## Business Recommendations

- **Discounting Strategy:** Discounts drive sales but also losses — optimization needed.
- **Product Potential:** Some low-rated products still sell well, suggesting areas for improvement.

🔍 Sales Forecasting & Business Insight Project — Real-World Data (2023)

In 2023, I completed a hands-on project focused on forecasting sales and uncovering business insights using real-world data. The project covered the full analytics workflow — from cleaning raw data to delivering model-driven recommendations.

📈 Project Highlights:

Conducted data preprocessing and feature engineering

Explored sales trends, customer loyalty, and discount impacts

Built and evaluated multiple regression models (linear & tree-based)

Used a range of metrics — MSE, RMSE, R², and MAPE — to compare model performance

Generated business insights with direct applications to pricing and customer retention strategies

🧠 This project helped strengthen my skills in:

Working with time-series influenced data

Choosing models based on both performance and business context

Communicating insights clearly for decision-making

💡 I’ve shared the full notebook and presentation on GitHub for anyone looking to learn from a practical, end-to-end analytics project.
